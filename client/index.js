    ## Key Insights
    - Provide 2-3 bullet points summarizing the overall results
    - Focus on patterns across responses
    
    ## Strengths
    - List 2-3 specific strengths with examples from responses
    - Mention which Ubuntu principles are strongest
    
    ## Growth Areas  
    - List 2-3 specific opportunities for improvement
    - Reference specific questions where scores were lower
    
    ## Recommendations
    - Provide 2-3 actionable suggestions
    - Include practical exercises or mindset shifts
    
    Formatting Requirements:
    - Use proper markdown headers (##) for each section
    - Bold important terms like "empathy" or "communal responsibility"
    - Include specific examples from responses when possible
    - Tone of report should address the individual test taker in third party (using words like "The candidate displays") not generalise.
